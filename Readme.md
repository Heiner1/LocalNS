__Brief:__

Use this script to setup a complete local running Nightscout instance. This script can either install:
- a local MongoDB instance or
- work without MongoDB and use static OpenAPS report files (recommended for tiny rigs) 

__Tested with:__


__Prerequisites__

0. Notebook

1. ???

2. Configure your notebook???
   `$ sudo XXXX
```   
1. Expand Filesystem   ==> Make use of the whole SD-CARD
2. Change User Password     	
3. Bootoptions ==> Choose what you want
4. Wait for Network at Boot ==> Set to No
5.  Internationalisation Options => Change Locale, Timezone, Keyboard Layout, Wi-Fi country to your needs
7. Advanced Options
A2. Hostname ==> Set your hostname. This will be used for the URL of your Nightscout 
A4. SSH ==> Enable SSH for remote access
```
3. 

__Usage:__

 1. open console on your notebook eg `ssh user@localadress` default-password `??????` and run ns-local-install script for an interactive install:
    ```
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heiner1/LocalNS/master/ns-local-install.sh | bash -
	```
	
	relax and drink some :coffee: - script runtime *over ???* on notebook???.
	
	You can also use a non-interactive install:
	```
	mkdir src 
    cd src
    git clone https://github.com/Heiner1/LocalNS.git
	cd LocalNS
	```
	You can then use 
	```
	bash ns-local-install.sh [--mongo=yhes] [--units=mg] [--storage=mongodb] [--oref0=yes] [--units=mg]
	```
	For example: 
	```
	bash ns-local-install.sh --mongo=yes --units=mg --storage=mongo --oref0=yes
	```
	
 2. after running the script you will have a running nightscout local installation. Now open editor with your config for nightscout.
    `nano /home/USER/cgm-remote-monitor/start-nightscout.sh`
     You need to configure at least the lines at the top of the file:
    `CUSTOM_TITLE=mysitename_without_spaces`
    `API_SECRET=my_12_characters_or_more_password``
	
    Put your personal password (at least 12 characters long) and the name of your site (just for display) there!
 
 3. once finished, restart nightscout with: `sudo /etc/init.d/nightscout stop && sudo /etc/init.d/nightscout start`
 4. navigate to http://10.0.0.198/ complete nightscout profile settings
 5. Have fun :smiley:

__Troubleshooting:__

 * nodejs manual start: USER@machine:~/cgm-remote-monitor $ start-nightscout.sh` (must be in cgm-remote-monitor directory)
 * nodejs / nightscout log: check `cat /var/log/openaps/nightscout.log` 
 * mongodb check `cat /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log` should contain: `[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017`

__Changelog:__

2016-11-13:

- upgrade nightscout to 0.9.1-dev-20161112, in order to support openaps-storage, see https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/pull/2114

2016-10-14: 

- change to nightscout 0.9.0 stable ()Grilled Cheese)
- add start_nightscout.sh instead of my.env

2016-09:
~~I forked the current dev-branch of nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor and changed the mongodb compatibility problems. Now it runs smoothly with mongodb 2.x on a raspi!
Maybe the pull request gets accepted soon. As soon as IÂ´m notified, I will change the script again to use the current dev-branch again.~~
The patches for mongo2.x compatibility are now merged back into the official dev branch.
